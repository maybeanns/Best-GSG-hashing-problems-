# Hashing
-Hashin is a technique used for storing and retrieving information as quickly as possible.
-The worst-case complexity of hashing is still O(n), but it gives O(1) on the average.

## Hashing ADT
• CreatHashTable: Creates a new hash table
• HashSearch: Searches the key in the hash table
• Hashlnsert: Inserts a new key into the hash table
• HashDelete: Deletes a key from a hash table
• DeleteHashTable: Deletes the hash table

## Components of Hashing
Hashing has four key components:
1) Hash Table
2) Hash Functions
3) Collisions
4) Collision Resolution Techniques

## Characteristics of Good Hash Functions
• Minimize collision
• Be easy and quick to compute
• Distribute key values evenly in the hash table
• Use all the information provided in the key
• Have a high load factor for a given set of keys
